# New Project Starter Kit

Copy this folder into a new project root and rename/move files as needed.

## What this gives you
- Standard workflow rules (`AGENTS.md`)
- Context bootstrap file (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`)
- Docs folder with changelog and startup checklist
- Default full-stack reference (optional by project need)

## Default stack (use only when needed)
- Frontend/app: React + Vite + TypeScript (VS Code + Codex workflow)
- Version control: GitHub
- Hosting: Render (app + n8n server)
- Database/auth/storage: Supabase
- Automations/backend flows: n8n

## First session flow
1. Open project root.
2. Confirm `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` exist.
3. Start chat and lock project context first.
4. Create first plan file in `docs/`.
5. Implement one task at a time.
