# Desire-Based Hooks for Website Conversion

**Purpose:** Use the “desire + relatable character + minimal constraints” hook system (from the video) to convert more visitors *once they land on your webpages* (landing pages, product pages, signup flows, pricing pages, waitlists, lead magnets).

This document is designed to be given directly to an LLM that:

* writes website copy,
* designs UI/UX,
* structures pages and flows,
* creates sections and components,
* and decides what to test.

It is **conversion-first**, not brand-poetry-first.

---

## Core idea

On a webpage, the “hook” is the first thing visitors *understand* (not just see). Usually this is:

* the hero headline,
* subheadline,
* above-the-fold proof,
* the primary CTA,
* and the first scannable bullets.

A conversion hook must immediately communicate **two signals**:

1. **Dream outcome (desire)**: the visitor’s *wanted end state*.
2. **Relatable character**: who achieves it (visitor / someone like them / you), framed so the visitor believes “this is achievable for me.”

**Critical rule:** People don’t decide to convert after reading everything. They decide *very early* whether to keep reading.

---

## The website translation of the video’s psychology

Visitors arrive in two mental modes:

### A) Browsers

They are curious, comparing options, or killing time.

### B) Potential buyers

They already carry an unsolved desire/problem in the background.

When they see the **dream outcome**, they lock in.
Immediately after, they judge **relatability**:

* “Is this for someone like me?”
* “Do I have the same conditions?”
* “Is there an unfair advantage here?”

If they sense unrealistic conditions (money, time, status, special access), belief collapses and they bounce.

**Therefore:** Above the fold must create belief: “This outcome is achievable for me.”

# Part 1 — LLM Pre-Work: The Questions the Model Must Ask Itself

The LLM must not write copy or design UI until it can answer these questions clearly.

## 1) Who is the visitor *right now*?

* What is their role? (e.g., founder, marketer, student, creator, buyer, operator)
* What is their experience level? (beginner / intermediate / advanced)
* What is their current state? (starting from scratch / stuck / scaling / switching)
* What are they afraid of wasting? (time / money / reputation / effort)
* What do they believe is “not possible for people like me”?

**Output required:** A single sentence: “This page is for ___ who want ___ but are constrained by ___.”

## 2) What is the visitor’s *dream outcome* (desire) in plain language?

* If they could snap their fingers, what would be true tomorrow?
* What does success look like in numbers, time, or feeling?
* What is the “best sleep of my life” version in this niche?

**Output required:** 3–7 dream outcomes phrased as end states.

## 3) What “unfair advantages” might they assume are required?

List likely disqualifiers:

* price / budget
* time available
* technical skill
* team size
* connections
* existing audience
* brand reputation
* geography
* legal/industry constraints

**Output required:** A “belief barrier list” (the reasons they’ll dismiss the promise).

## 4) What makes the character relatable here?

Choose the framing type(s):

* **You (visitor) as the character**: “If you want X…”
* **Me/Us (creator/company) as character**: “We achieved X…”
* **Third party**: “A customer like you achieved X…”

Then decide *which relatability amplifiers* to include:

* “starting from scratch”
* “without ads”
* “with a small team”
* “with no audience”
* “using only a phone/laptop”
* “in 3 steps”
* “in under 10 minutes a day”

**Rule:** Only include amplifiers that are true and match the offer.

## 5) What is the method you will actually deliver?

* What is the mechanism of change?
* What will the user do differently?
* What is included (tool, template, service, product, coaching)?

**Output required:** A one-paragraph “how it works” explanation that a beginner can picture.

## 6) What is the conversion action and what is the exchange?

* What is the CTA? (start trial / book call / download / join waitlist / buy)
* What does the visitor give? (email, time, money, commitment)
* What do they get immediately? (access, template, next step)

**Rule:** The CTA must feel consistent with the promise.

## 7) What proof is available and what proof is missing?

* numbers (leads, revenue, time saved)
* before/after
* testimonials
* logos
* screenshots
* case studies

**Output required:** A prioritized proof plan:

1. strongest proof above the fold
2. deeper proof mid-page
3. risk reducers near CTA

# Part 2 — Website Hook System: Converting Hooks for Pages

In video, the hook is 1–2 lines. On web, the hook is an **above-the-fold package**.

## The Above-the-Fold Hook Package (Mandatory)

The LLM must build the hero as:

1. **Headline (dream outcome)**
2. **Subheadline (relatable character + minimal constraints)**
3. **3–5 bullets (method clarity + constraint removal)**
4. **Primary CTA (single best next action)**
5. **Proof element (immediate credibility)**
6. **Risk reducer (optional, if high friction)**

### Design constraint

The visitor must understand the promise within **5 seconds** of scanning.

---

# Part 3 — The Five Hook Templates Adapted for Web

Each template outputs a complete above-the-fold hero set.

## Template A — “About Us/Me” (Past achievement)

**Pattern:** “We/I achieved X using Y (simple/replicable) — here’s how you can too.”

### Use when

* your brand has strong proof/credibility
* you can show a measurable result

### Hero formula

* Headline: **We achieved X**
* Subheadline: **without Y constraint** (or “with simple method”) + “so you can too”
* Bullets: steps/what’s included
* Proof: numbers, screenshots, case study thumbnail
* CTA: “Get the same system” / “See how it works”

### Examples (fill in X/Y)

* “We turned short videos into predictable leads — without ads.”
* “We doubled demo bookings in 14 days using one page structure.”

---

## Template B — “If we started from scratch” (Hypothetical future)

**Pattern:** “If we had to achieve X from zero, we’d do Y.”

### Use when

* audience is beginner-heavy
* you want to reduce intimidation

### Hero formula

* Headline: “If you’re starting from scratch and want X…”
* Subheadline: “Here’s the exact Y we’d use (in N steps).”
* Proof: “used by X customers” or a mini-case study
* CTA: “Get the starter plan”

---

## Template C — “To You” (Visitor as character, statement)

**Pattern:** “If you want X, do Y.”

### Use when

* you want maximum relatability
* your method is simple and direct

### Hero formula

* Headline: “If you want X…”
* Subheadline: “Use Y (simple method) — even if you have Z constraint.”
* Bullets: “You’ll get…”
* CTA: action-oriented

---

## Template D — “Can you?” (Visitor as character, question)

**Pattern:** “Is it possible to get X under Y conditions?”

### Use when

* the visitor doubts it’s possible
* the market is skeptical

### Hero formula

* Headline: “Can you get X without Y?”
* Subheadline: “Yes — if you do Z.”
* Proof: show credibility immediately
* CTA: “See the proof” / “Try it free”

---

## Template E — “They just did” (Third-party case study)

**Pattern:** “Someone like you achieved X under Y conditions — here’s the playbook.”

### Use when

* you lack brand trust
* testimonials/case studies are strong

### Hero formula

* Headline: “A [relatable person] just achieved X…”
* Subheadline: “with Y conditions (no audience/no ads/small budget)”
* Proof: testimonial + numbers
* CTA: “Get the same template”

---

# Part 4 — Constraint Management (Non-negotiable)

## The Constraint Audit

Before finalizing the hero, the LLM must run an audit:

### A) Identify disqualifying constraints accidentally introduced

Examples:

* “$1,200 device”
* “enterprise plan”
* “our team of 12”
* “we spent $50k on ads”

### B) Replace with achievable framing

* “with a free tool”
* “with your phone”
* “in under 30 minutes”
* “no ads required”
* “works with a small audience”

### C) Truth constraint

Never promise constraint removal that isn’t true.
If a constraint is real (e.g., needs budget), move it later and frame it transparently with ranges.

# Part 5 — UI/UX Instructions: How to Build Pages that Match Desire-Based Hooking

## 1) Information hierarchy (scan order)

The LLM must design for the scan pattern:

1. Headline
2. Subheadline
3. Bullets
4. Proof snippet
5. CTA
6. Secondary navigation (optional)

If the page is complex, add a “sticky CTA” after the visitor scrolls.

## 2) The “Belief Bridge” section (required)

Immediately after the fold, add a section that answers:

* “Why this is achievable for someone like you”
* “What makes this different from the stuff you’ve tried”

Format options:

* 3 cards: “Works even if…”
* short story: “We built this because…”
* mini case study: “From X to Y in Z days”

## 3) Proof placement rules

* **Above fold:** at least one credible proof element
* **Mid-page:** deeper proof (case study/testimonial grid)
* **Near CTA:** risk reducers (guarantee, refund, cancellation, privacy)

## 4) Friction reducers

Use UX elements to lower “conditions”:

* no credit card required
* cancel anytime
* clear time estimates
* show what’s included
* show the first step after clicking CTA

## 5) CTA clarity rules

* One primary CTA per viewport.
* Use a verb + outcome: “Get the template”, “Start improving X”, “Book a growth plan call”.
* Avoid vague CTAs: “Submit”, “Learn more” (unless it opens a modal with the method).

## 6) Message match rules

The hook promise must match:

* ad / short / link text
* landing page hero
* first section after fold
* CTA destination

If there’s mismatch, conversion drops.

# Part 6 — LLM Copywriting Output Requirements (Exhaustive)

For any page, the LLM must output:

## A) Inputs recap

* audience
* dream outcome(s)
* constraint assumptions
* chosen character frame
* offer mechanism
* CTA
* proof inventory

## B) Hook set (web versions)

Generate **at least 25 hero headline options**:

* 5 templates × 5 variants

Each option must include:

* headline
* subheadline
* 3 bullets
* CTA text
* proof slot suggestion

## C) Score and select

Score each hero option 1–5 on:

1. desire clarity
2. relatability
3. constraint minimization
4. specificity
5. truthfulness

Pick top 3 and explain tradeoffs.

## D) Full page structure

Produce a section outline with copy blocks:

1. Hero (hook package)
2. Belief bridge
3. How it works (steps)
4. Proof section
5. Offer detail (what’s included)
6. Objections FAQ
7. Final CTA + risk reducer

## E) UX component list

List UI components to build:

* hero layout type
* CTA button(s)
* proof component (logos/testimonials/case study)
* pricing table or offer cards
* FAQ accordion
* sticky CTA (if needed)
* form fields + validation

Provide microcopy for:

* form labels
* error states
* confirmation state

---

# Part 7 — Objection Handling (Relatability at scale)

## The 6 common objections to neutralize

The LLM must explicitly address these somewhere on-page:

1. “This won’t work for my niche.”
2. “I don’t have time.”
3. “I’m not technical.”
4. “I don’t have an audience.”
5. “I’ve tried things like this before.”
6. “It’s too expensive / risky.”

**Rule:** When addressing objections, keep the visitor as the character:

* “Even if you…”
* “Designed for…”
* “Works when…”

---

# Part 8 — Testing Plan (LLM should propose experiments)

The LLM must propose A/B tests focused on the hook ingredients:

## A/B test categories

1. Dream outcome phrasing (more vivid vs more specific)
2. Character framing (you vs we vs they)
3. Constraint framing (no ads vs low budget vs small team)
4. Proof type above fold (numbers vs testimonial vs logos)
5. CTA wording (outcome verb vs neutral)

## Success metrics

* bounce rate
* scroll depth
* CTA click-through
* form completion
* lead quality (downstream)

---

# Part 9 — Implementation Checklist (LLM self-check before shipping)

The LLM must confirm:

* [ ] Dream outcome is explicit in headline.
* [ ] Character frame is explicit (you/we/they).
* [ ] No early disqualifying constraints were introduced.
* [ ] At least one proof element is visible above the fold.
* [ ] CTA is singular, clear, and consistent with the promise.
* [ ] The first section after fold reinforces achievability.
* [ ] Page includes objection answers.
* [ ] Mobile layout preserves the scan order.
* [ ] Message match from traffic source to page is maintained.

# Part 10 — Reusable Prompt Block for Your Website-Building LLM

Paste and use this whenever generating a webpage.

```text
You are a website-building LLM. Your job is to design a landing page that converts by using a desire-based hook system:

Non-negotiable: Above the fold must communicate (1) the visitor’s dream outcome and (2) a relatable character frame with minimal constraints.

Before writing, answer these questions:
1) Who is the visitor, what do they want, and what do they fear wasting?
2) What is the dream outcome in plain language? List 3–7.
3) What unfair-advantage assumptions might make them dismiss this?
4) Which character frame will you use (you / us / third party) and why?
5) What is the mechanism (what changes for them) and what exactly is included?
6) What is the single best CTA and what do they get immediately?
7) What proof exists and what proof must be created?

Then produce:
A) 25 above-the-fold hero variants (5 templates × 5 variants). Each variant includes: headline, subheadline, 3 bullets, CTA text, proof slot.
B) Score each variant 1–5 on desire clarity, relatability, constraint minimization, specificity, truthfulness.
C) Pick top 3 and explain tradeoffs.
D) Output full page structure: Hero → Belief bridge → How it works → Proof → Offer → FAQ → Final CTA.
E) Output UI components and mobile-first layout notes.
F) Propose 5 A/B tests focused on hook ingredients.

Templates:
1) About Us/Me: “We/I achieved X using Y…”
2) If we started from scratch: “If you want X starting from scratch, do Y…”
3) To You: “If you want X, do Y…”
4) Can You?: “Can you get X without Y? Yes, if…”
5) They just did: “Someone like you got X under Y conditions…”

Avoid introducing disqualifying constraints early (price, special access, big team, large ad spend) unless the audience is specifically that segment.
```

# Notes for adaptation

Replace X/Y/Z with your niche:

* X = dream outcome
* Y = method/conditions
* Z = relatability amplifier

If you provide your product/service and target audience, this spec can be instantiated into a complete landing page draft with hook variants, section copy, and UI component structure.
