## Plan: Mobile Terminal Focus Mode

- [x] Add enter/exit focus mode controls in Terminal tab header.
- [x] Add persisted focus mode UI state in frontend storage.
- [x] Apply full-screen terminal-focus CSS mode that hides non-terminal sections.
- [x] Keep terminal tab active while in focus mode and auto-exit on switching tabs.
- [x] Hide non-essential terminal sections (subtools/mirror) in focus mode.
- [x] Validate JS syntax and TypeScript project check.
