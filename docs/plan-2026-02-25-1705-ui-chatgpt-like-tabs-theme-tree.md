- [x] Refactor frontend to tab-first app shell (Terminal, Files, Projects, Access, More)
- [x] Add dark/light/auto theme system with persistent selection
- [x] Add retractable secondary-module visibility controls with persistence
- [x] Rework terminal controls and include Focus Terminal help semantics
- [x] Add collapsible terminal mirror and mobile keys sections
- [x] Redesign file manager with clickable folder tree and breadcrumbs
- [x] Keep existing auth/project/file/terminal flows functional in new UI
- [x] Validate frontend script syntax and selector consistency
