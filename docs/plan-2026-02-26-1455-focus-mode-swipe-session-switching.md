## Plan: Focus Mode Swipe Session Switching

- [x] Add swipe gesture tracking on terminal viewport for touch devices.
- [x] Enable swipe-left/right session switching only in focus mode.
- [x] Keep gesture thresholds conservative to avoid interfering with vertical scroll.
- [x] Handle edge cases (no active session, single session, boundary sessions).
- [x] Validate frontend syntax and backend typecheck.
